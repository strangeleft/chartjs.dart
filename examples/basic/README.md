An example of using [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/).

This example is ported from [this sample](https://github.com/nnnick/Chart.js/blob/b8691c9581bff0eeecb34f98e678dc045a18f33e/samples/line.html) in the `Chart.js` repository.

To view the example, run `pub serve example` from the root directory of this project – the directory containing `pubspec.yaml`.

```console
> pub serve example
Loading source assets...
Serving js example on http://localhost:8080
Build completed successfully
```

You can view it with Dartium or any other browser.
